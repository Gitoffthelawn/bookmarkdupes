A WebExtension which can display/remove duplicate bookmarks, empty folders, or descriptions

After installing bookmarkdupes, the usage is rather simple:

Click on bookmardupes' symbol (duplicate stars) and then
select in the popup window what you want to display:

1. Bookmark duplicates (exact)
2. Bookmark duplicates (similar)
3. Empty folders
4. All bookmarks

The difference between 1 and 2 is that in case

1. The URLs of the bookmarks must match exactly
2. The URLs of the bookmarks must match up to the first ? symbol;
   the URL text after the ? symbol is appended to the displayed bookmark.

After this, you will be offered the list of bookmarks with checkboxes;
in case 1 and 2 numbers indicate the order in which matching bookmarks
were added according to the internally stored date.
There are also buttons to select/unselect convenient sets of checkboxes.

Finally, there are buttons to remove the selected bookmarks in case 1-3,
or to strip the descriptions of the selected bookmarks in case 4.

When you close the popup window and removal of bookmarks/comments is not
yet finished, it will continue in the background.

## Known Bugs

1. Certain special folders (e.g. rss folders) are not distinguished from
   empty folders.

2. Stripping of descriptions works by replacing the bookmark by a freshly
   created one. In particular, it updates the internally stored date when
   the bookmark was added.
3. In certain situations, it might happen that the procedure of creating a
   new bookmark (when stripping descriptions, see bug 2 above) places the
   bookmark with the freshly created one too high. In particular, this might
   happen in connection with special folders/bookmarks as in 1 or when you
   added a bookmark between pressing the button for displaying all bookmarks
   and stripping comments: After you modified bookmarks you should better
   press the button for displaying all bookmarks again to update the data.
