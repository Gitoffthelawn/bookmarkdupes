A WebExtension which can display/remove duplicate bookmarks, empty folders, or descriptions

After installing bookmarkdupes, the usage is rather simple:

Click on bookmardupes' symbol (duplicate stars) and then
select in the new tab what you want to display:

1. Bookmark duplicates (exact)
2. Bookmark duplicates (similar)
3. Empty folders
4. All bookmarks

The difference between 1 and 2 is that in case

1. The URLs of the bookmarks must match exactly
2. The URLs of the bookmarks must match up to the first ? symbol;
   the URL text after the ? symbol is appended to the displayed bookmark.

After this, you will be offered the list of bookmarks with checkboxes;
in case 1 and 2 numbers indicate the order in which matching bookmarks
were added according to the internally stored date.
There are also buttons to select/unselect convenient sets of checkboxes.

Finally, there are buttons to remove the selected bookmarks in case 1-3,
or to strip the descriptions of the selected bookmarks in case 4.
(The latter has some side effects, see section **Known Bugs**).

## Important

When you reorganized/added/removed bookmarks, make sure to update the
displayed list (by pressing the corresponding button) before removing
bookmarks or stripping descriptions!
In particular, stripping descriptions with an outdated list will move
the corresponding bookmarks to their previous location in the bookmark menu!

## Known Bugs

1. Live bookmarks are falsely recognized as empty folders, see
   https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/4
2. Stripping of descriptions works by replacing the bookmark by a freshly
   created one. In particular, it updates the bookmark creation date.
3. Stripping of descriptions creates bookmarks in the place where it was when
   the displayed list was calculated, see
   https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/11 and the second part of
   https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/8
4. In some firefox versions (e.g. 55.0.3) it has been reported that pressing
   the duplicate stars does not open a new tab. For a discussion of this
   problem and of possible workarounds, see
   https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/38
