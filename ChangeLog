# ChangeLog for squashmount

*bookmarkdupes-5.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Add expert rules to ignore certain bookmarks
	- Use expert rules to define when bookmarks are considered to be dupes.
	  This replaces the previous unsatisfactory "Similar Dupes" button and
	  implements also https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/45
	- Default regexp rules deal with much more than \? tails
	- bugfix: increase minimal gecko version to 48.0 to reflect that
	  manifest.json itself apparently requires that version, see
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/44
	- bugfix: calculation error messages are now displayed correctly
	- bugfix: use safe ids for bookmarks
	- internal: remove redundant SplitNumber

	Juan Salvador Aleixandre Talens:
	- Update es locales

*bookmarkdupes-4.2:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Add an options page with a link as an alternative way to open the
	  extension. This is mainly meant as a workaround for
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/38

	Juan Salvador Aleixandre Talens:
	- Update es locales

*bookmarkdupes-4.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:

	- Update ru locales

*bookmarkdupes-4.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Use tab instead of panel
	- Speed up a lot and save memory by almost complete rewriting:
	  In a tab there is no need to save state in a background process.
	- Speed up counting of marks
	- Display bookmarks as links
	- Display URLs common to groups only once
	- Support folder selection (instead of only 2 categories)
	- Provide buttons for not marking first/last/oldest/newest for folders
	- Let buttons for marking folders appear only optionally.
	  Thanks to perdolka for the idea:
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/32
	- Display list titles in more places
	- Try to force display syncing with setTimeout
	- Disable checkboxes while updating them
	- Add a checkbox to disable counting
	- bugfix: mark also last group for folder/category selection

	- Use titles (tooltips) where possible
	- Show bookmark URLs as titles (tooltips)

*bookmarkdupes-2.4:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:

	- Add buttons to mark all but oldest/newest bookmarks, see
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/9
	- Display number of marked bookmarks
	- Document that stripping descriptions changes internally stored date
	- Document necessity to recalculate after bookmark changes
	- Prefer bookmark index from bookmark API (if it exists) over counting.
	  This might mitigate https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/11
	- internal: remove currently unused asynchronous code
	- internal: use null instead of {} to free closures
	- internal: XHTML Transitional -> Strict

	YFdyh000 <yfdyh000 at gmail.com>:

*bookmarkdupes-2.3:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Serious bugfix (regression): Stripping of bookmarks failed, see
	  https://github.com/vaeth/bookmarkdupes/issues/8

*bookmarkdupes-2.2:
	Henaro aka Ironwool:
	- Create uk locales
	- Create ru locales

	Juan Salvador Aleixandre Talens:
	- Create es locales

	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Display total number of bookmarks
	- Calculate in background
	- Calculate optionally asynchronously (not yet used)

*bookmarkdupes-2.1
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Display result of removing/stripping only once

*bookmarkdupes-2.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Continue removing/stripping in background if popup is closed,
	  and redisplay current state when popup is re-opened:
	  Other things can be done even if stripping should take ages.
	  Moreover, this solves the bug that when the popup was closed during
	  stripping in a bad moment, a bookmark might have been duplicated.
	- Add a progress bar for removing/stripping
	- Disable buttons visibly when locked
	- Hash bookmark data when searching all bookmarks, resulting in
	  slightly slower search but considerably faster stripping
	- Refactor searching, resulting in possibly slight speedup
	- Fix typo in localization id (causing strange or empty message)
	- Bugfix for detection of bookmark type
	- Various minor typo fixes in text messages

*bookmarkdupes-1.0
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Show progress when removing/stripping
	- Add emergency stop button
	- More specific messages
	- Use textContent instead of redundant child text nodes
	- Bugfix: Removing/stripping empty lists might have locked buttons
	- Code cleanup: remove unused arguments

*bookmarkdupes-0.5
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Avoid unsafe assignment to innerHTML

*bookmarkdupes-0.4
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- bookmarkdupes can now also strip descriptions of bookmarks
	- Buttons accept now only left mouse button
	- Update description
	- Serialize removal of bookmarks: slower, but the only reliable way to
	  handle certain errors, e.g. if another extension modifies bookmarks
	- Avoid global variables: use nested functions and closures only

*bookmarkdupes-0.3
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- bookmarkdupes can now also display/remove empty bookmark folders
	- Unmodifiable and other strange bookmarks are more reliably excluded
	- Bugfix in handling of strange events
